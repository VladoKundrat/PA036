CHECKLIST EVALUATION:
[OK]     project is compiled using 'maven clean install' and all tests are passing
[OK]     every team member contributed enough
[NOK] -1 equals(), hashcode() 
		 in Event entity equals() should contain "instanceof" instead of getClass()
[OK]     (every minor occurrence of missing methods/tests) - considering the instructions of the given milestone I find the solution quite sufficient  

Max points: 10
Total points: 9

GENERAL COMMENTS:
- missing methods in entity Result in class diagram (they possibly could be included because they are generally used in all other entities)
- I would recommend using one standard for equals and hashcode methods as they are vastly different

STRONG POINTS OF THE PROJECT:
- detailed javadoc
- complex use case diagram
- properly named attributes
- good association mapping between entities

WEAKNESSES OF THE PROJECT:
- inconsistent use of annotations @Transactional and @Table (Sport, SportDao)
- inconsistent equals and hashcode methods
