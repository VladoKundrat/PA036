Evauluation Checklist

  - To start the web application you have to configure maven plugin (tomcat7
    or jetty). It is very important that it’s super easy to start the web
    application from command line. So for example using tomcat7 plugin, the
    following sequence of commands should start the web application: “mvn
    clean install && cd web && mvn tomcat7:run”
    [OK]
  - The web application must be available on the following HTTP context
    http://localhost:8080/pa036
    [OK]
  - Your application should use in-memory database. This means that
    after application restart (killing web container and starting it
    again with mvn tomcat7:run) the data may be reset.
    [OK]
  - Implement the user interface using Spring MVC or Angular JS. 
    [OK]
  - The user interface should allow to carry out all business
    functions of your system.
    [OK]
  - You should fill in all the necessary data
    automatically. So for example you can use Web Listener
    to load data during Web Application startup.
    [OK]
  - Make sure there are validations implemented on user interface.
    [OK]
  - Your user interface should use either Facade
    layer or REST layer to access the system. Do
    not directly access database and do not
    directly use Service layer.
    [OK]
  - Each member of the team must implement
    (mostly independently, without
     copy-pasting) part of user interface.
    Including controller and view.
    [OK]

  - Your application should have a basic REST interface.
    [OK]
  - At least one entity and operations on that entity must be exposed.
    [OK]
  - The REST must be accessible at http://localhost:8080/pa036/rest
    [OK]
  - You should include a README file with instructions how to test the REST
    interface (e.g. CURL commands for command line).
    [OK]

  
  - There should be at least 2 roles in the system (e.g. Administrator, User). Each role should have some differences in user interface or in capabilities.
    [OK]
  - There should be login form (not HTTP Basic)
    [OK]
  - Password should not be saved in the database in open form.
    [OK]

Comments:
 - It took me a while to find a username and password for users that are
   managers - this could be mentioned in the documentation
   https://github.com/m-mato/sem/blob/master/sem-persistence/src/main/resources/scripts/init-db.sql
 - Didn't find any obvious bugs when using the user interface
